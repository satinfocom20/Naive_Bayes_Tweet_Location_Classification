# Naive_Bayes_Tweet_Location_Classification
A classic application of Bayes Law is in document classification. Let's examine one particular classification problem: estimating where a Twitter "tweet" was sent, based only on the content of the tweet itself. We'll use a bag-of-words model, which means that we'll represent a tweet in terms of just an unordered "bag" of words instead of modeling anything about its grammatical structure. In other words, a tweet can be modeled as simply a histogram over the words of the English language (or, more generally, all possible tokens that occur on Twitter). If, for example, there are 100,000 words in the English language, then a tweet can be represented as a 100,000-dimensional binary vector, wherein each dimension there is a 1 if the word appears
in the tweet and a zero otherwise. Of course, vectors will be very sparse (most entries are zero).

We will implement a Naive Bayes classifier for this problem. For a given tweet D, we'll need to evaluateP(L=l|w1,w2,...wn), the posterior probability that a tweet was taken at one particular location (e.g., l = Chicago) given the words in that tweet. Make the Naive Bayes assumption, which says that for any i not equals to j, wi is independent from wj given L.
